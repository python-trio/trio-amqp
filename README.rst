async_amqp
==========

The ``async_amqp`` library is a pure-Python implementation of the `AMQP 0.9.1 protocol`_.

Built on top of anyio_, it provides an API based on coroutines, making it easy to write highly concurrent applications.

Bug reports, patches and suggestions welcome! Just open an issue_ or send a `pull request`_.

Status
------

The code works. Porting code that uses aioamqp (or even plain
python-amqp) should be reasonably straightforward.

All tests from aioamqp have been ported and succeed.

`async_amqp` was renamed from `asyncamqp`, but that was taken on pypi. `asyncamqp`
was renamed from `trio_amqp` but anyio support was deemed to be a good
idea. `trio_amqp` in turn was forked from `aioamqp`.


tests
-----

To run the tests, you'll need to install the Python test dependencies::

    pip install -r ci/requirements_dev.txt

Tests require an instance of RabbitMQ. You can start a new instance using docker::

     docker run -d --log-driver=syslog -e RABBITMQ_NODENAME=my-rabbit --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3-management

RabbitMQ requires a "guest" user (password "guest") with admin privileges.

You can run the tests with ``make test`` (requires ``pytest``).


tests using docker-compose
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Start RabbitMQ using ``docker-compose up -d rabbitmq``. When RabbitMQ has started, start the tests using ``docker-compose up --build aioamqp-test``


Future work
-----------

* Add coverage reporting. Increase coverage (duh).

* Try restarting a failed AMQP connection instead of cancelling everything.
